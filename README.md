Hi I absolutely hated this. Okay, moving on...
I didn't fact check, so the website seemed fine. I was already super behind and wanted to turn this in on time so I focused less on the actual data and more on the only thing I know how to do: making the website prettier.
I asked Chatgpt to do that for me, it talked back, I made it give me straight code, pasted them in, and it worked alright. 
I mean making a dropdown menu on a webpage is something useful for just about any article, so like an example could be like an article on local crime, and then showing each crime and how often it happens, I don't know.
